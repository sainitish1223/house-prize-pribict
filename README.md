# house_price_predict

In this project, we use linear regression as we can predict the house price easily. 
Linear regression uses a traditional slope-intercept form, where a and b are the Coefficient that  
we try to “learn” and produce the most accurate predictions.

The real estate industry operates in a dynamic environment characterized by a myriad of factors  
influencing property values. Traditional methods of house price estimation often fall short in  
capturing the complexity inherent in real estate markets, leading to suboptimal decision-making for  
buyers and sellers. The lack of a comprehensive predictive tool that integrates diverse features such  
as location, property attributes, and market trends hinders stakeholders from making well-informed  
decisions. 
 This project addresses the pressing need for a sophisticated machine learning model capable of  
accurately predicting house prices.
